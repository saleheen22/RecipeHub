- Your recipes will persist between sessions until you clear your browser data

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

- **Navbar**: Navigation bar with the "Submit Recipe" button

All recipe data is stored in your browser's localStorage under the key `recipehub_recipes`.
